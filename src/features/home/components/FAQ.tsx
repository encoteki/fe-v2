    question: 'What is NFT ?',
    answer:
      'NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated. NFTs represent real-world objects like real estate and artwork, or digital objects like graphic art, videos, and music. With NFTs, people can buy, sell, and trade their assets more efficiently while reducing the probability of fraud. NFTs also have utilities that include things like a digital asset, a service, membership, access to specific events, and any other advantages, depending on the creator.',
